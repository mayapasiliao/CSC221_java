# CSC221_Assignment3
Consider the management and maintenance of a "library database" in a certain school. 
It holds the information of material resources in use for students in that school. This information is 
recorded based on the object-oriented design. The Database may use ArrayList instead of Array to hold the 
collection of Item's references. Add an appropriate set of overloading/overriding methods to support the 
object hierarchy assumed in this context. Implement the hierarchy, populate Database with at least two items 
per non-abstract class, and show the "unsorted" and "sorted" list of the set of those instances. The minimal 
requirement of this assignment is to realize the database sort based on the lexicographical order of id as well 
as any combination of data variables. For instance, database records are shown based on the lexicographical order 
of "title," followed by"addedOn," and followed by "director."
